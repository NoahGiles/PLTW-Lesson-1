## 1.1.2 <br/>
#5. Both MediaLib and SecondClass have main() methods. <br/>
#7. String, float, double, and int are four variable types. <br/>
#17. Song@75412c2f is shown. <br/>
Conclusion : <br/>
#1. The advantages of accessors and mutators is that they are easily modified and stored, yet they also are somewhat
difficult to understand immediately. <br/>
#2. The song, movie, and book classes have the same title and rating variables, but have different class names.
To reduce duplication in these classes, it is possible to change what information that the classes provide. <br/>
## 1.1.3 <br/>
#8. If I were to make a mutator method to set the favorite variable, it might look like <br/>
public void setFavorite(Boolean q) <br/>
{<br/>
favorite = q; <br/>
} <br/>
I prefer using getters and setters for the mutator favorite. <br/>
#12. <br/>
a. This naming convention is called Camel Case. <br/>
b. totalCost should be a double because the song prices are doubles. <br/>
**Conclusion :** <br/>
#1. You would have more than one constructor for a class in order to store different values for variables. If you had a constructor for a movie class with rating, title, and duration, another constructor might be used for another movie. <br/>
## 1.1.4 <br/>
#25. a, b, and c appear to use short-circuit evaluation, given they both have || and && operators.<br/>
#27. <br/>
a. if (!sunny && !clear) <br/> 
b. if (!(!raining || !snowing)) <br/>
#28. <br/>
a. if (temperature <= 75) <br/>
b. if (temperature > 100) <br/>
c. if (temperature < 32 || temperature > 32) <br/>
**Conclusion :**<br/>
1. if (str != "" && str != null && str.length() < 80)"<br/>
2.  if (!(str == "")) <br/>
